# ðŸ”Ž Problem/Request

A deployment is not responding to external requests, and the service appears to be unresponsive or inaccessible.

* Context: The deployment was recently updated to accommodate changes in the application's network configuration. Since the update, external connectivity issues have arisen, causing service disruptions.
* Hint: Examine the deployment and service definitions to ensure that all network configurations align correctly.


# ðŸ§ª Validation

To validate the solution, verify that the application responds correctly to network requests. Use the following command to test connectivity:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/my-service 8080:80
curl localhost:8080
```

This forwards the local port 8080 to the service port 80 and attempts a curl request. Ensure you receive a successful response from the application.
