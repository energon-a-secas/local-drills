# Local Drills

This repository aims to provide a collection of near real-world cloud environment simulations to troubleshoot issues that you can run locally, so no worries of costs or getting things up-and-running.

This has three goals:

1. Provide members that haven't faced the same challenges the oportunity to learn from each other.
    - Once a project passes the implementation phase, you will get less experience because the scope will consist mainly of providing support or, at best, occasional new features.
    - Unless you actively try to dig and find answers about how and why someone designed the thing you support. You will probably miss most of the nitty-gritty details.
2. Help you understand what you don't know.
    - While your company might document past issues, reading static documentation about problem-free systems is hardly engaging or educational.
    - These simulations serve as "live documentation," allowing you to learn by doing.
    - You don't have to wait for something to break to realize that you have knowledge gaps.
3. It doubles as interview challenges.
    - Sometimes, you haven't had the chance to work with a particular technology, but you have the skills to get up to speed—this is for you.

This won't be a replacement for real hands-on experience, but at least it's a start to facilitate you streghtning your skills in advance.

Online course labs will rarely throw curveballs your way, so you are welcome!


## Cases

Our main objective is to provide everything you need to simulate environments like **AWS** (using [LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/)) and **EKS** (using Minikube)

- [AWS Drills](./localstack/README.md)
- [Kubernetes Drills](./minikube/README.md)

## Drill Structure

Not to gatekeep, but prioritize real cases based on your own experience. Things that have made you think "Wow, I'm glad I know how to do that!" or "If someone can figure this out, I'm hiring them!
