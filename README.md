# Local Drills

> "Try Harder."

This repository is for those who want to simulate real-world cloud environments on their local machine, whether for learning, testing, or experimentation. If your work environment is too stable or standardized to offer unique challenges, this is your chance to step out of the comfort zone, connect the dots, and sharpen your problem-solving skills.

Our main objective is to provide everything you need to simulate environments like **AWS** (using [LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/)) and **EKS** (using Minikube)

## Cases

- [AWS Drills](./localstack/README.md)
- [Kubernetes Drills](./minikube/README.md)

## Lab Creation

Not to gatekeep, but prioritize real cases based on your own experience. Things that have made you think "Wow, I'm glad I know how to do that!" or "If someone can figure this out, I'm hiring them!
